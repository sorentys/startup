# HTTP

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN An overview of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)

HTTP is how the web talks. When a web browser makes a request to a web server it does it using the HTTP protocol. In previous instruction we discussed how to use HTTP. Now, we will talk about the internals of HTTP. Just like becoming fluent in a foreign language makes a visit to another country more enjoyable, understanding how to speak HTTP helps you communicate effectively when talking on the web.

When a web client (e.g. a web browser) and a web server talk they exchange HTTP requests and responses. The browser will make an HTTP request and the server will generate an HTTP response. You can see the HTTP exchange by using the browser's debugger or by using a console tool like `curl`. For example, in your console you can use `curl` to make the following request.

```sh
curl -v -s http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Helping.html
```

### Request

The HTTP request for the above command would look like the following.

```http
GET /hypertext/WWW/Helping.html HTTP/1.1
Host: info.cern.ch
Accept: text/html
```

An HTTP request has this general syntax.

```yaml
<verb> <url path, parameters, anchor> <version>
[<header key: value>]*
[

  <body>
]
```

The first line of the HTTP request contains the `verb` of the request, followed by the path, parameters, and anchor of the URL, and finally the version of HTTP being used. The following lines are optional headers that are defined by key value pairs. After the headers you have an optional body. The body start is delimited from the headers with two new lines.

In the above example, we are asking to `GET` a resource found at the path `/hypertext/WWW/Helping.html`. The version used by the request is `HTTP/1.1`. This is followed by two headers. The first specifies the requested host (i.e. domain name). The second specifies what type of resources the client will accept. The resource type is always a [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) as defined by internet governing body IANA. In this case we are asking for HTML.

### Response

The response to the above request looks like this.

```yaml
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 06 Dec 2022 21:54:42 GMT
Server: Apache
Last-Modified: Thu, 29 Oct 1992 11:15:20 GMT
ETag: "5f0-28f29422b8200"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 1520
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

<TITLE>Helping -- /WWW</TITLE>
<NEXTID 7>
<H1>How can I help?</H1>There are lots of ways you can help if you are interested in seeing
the <A NAME=4 HREF=TheProject.html>web</A> grow and be even more useful...
```

An HTTP response has the following syntax.

```yaml
<version> <status code> <status string>
[<header key: value>]*
[

  <body>
]
```

You can see that the response syntax is similar to the request syntax. The major difference is that the first line represents the version and the status of the response.

Understanding the meaning of the common HTTP verbs, status codes, and headers is important for you to understand, as you will use them in developing a web application. Take some time to internalize the following common values.

## Verbs

There are several verbs that describe what the HTTP request is asking for. The list below only describes the most common ones.

| Verb    | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET     | Get the requested resource. This can represent a request to get a single resource or a resource representing a list of resources.                                                                                                                        |
| POST    | Create a new resource. The body of the request contains the resource. The response should include a unique ID of the newly created resource.                                                                                                             |
| PUT     | Update a resource. Either the URL path, HTTP header, or body must contain the unique ID of the resource being updated. The body of the request should contain the updated resource. The body of the response may contain the resulting updated resource. |
| DELETE  | Delete a resource. Either the URL path or HTTP header must contain the unique ID of the resource to delete.                                                                                                                                              |
| OPTIONS | Get metadata about a resource. Usually only HTTP headers are returned. The resource itself is not returned.                                                                                                                                              |

## Status codes

It is important that you use the standard HTTP status codes in your HTTP responses so that the client of a request can know how to interpret the response. The codes are partitioned into five blocks.

- 1xx - Informational.
- 2xx - Success.
- 3xx - Redirect to some other location, or that the previously cached resource is still valid.
- 4xx - Client errors. The request is invalid.
- 5xx - Server errors. The request cannot be satisfied due to an error on the server.

Within those ranges here are some of the more common codes. See the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) for a full description of status codes.

| Code | Text                                                                                 | Meaning                                                                                                                           |

## Headers

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)

HTTP headers specify metadata about a request or response. This includes things like how to handle security, caching, data formats, and cookies. Some common headers that you will use include the following.

| Header                      | Example                              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Body

The format of the body of an HTTP request or response is defined by the `Content-Type` header. For example, it may be HTML text (text/html), a binary image format (image/png), JSON (application/json), or JavaScript (text/javascript). A client may specify what formats it accepts using the `accept` header.

## Cookies

![Cookie](webServicesCookie.png)

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Using HTTP cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)

HTTP itself is stateless. This means that one HTTP request does not know anything about a previous or future request. However, that does not mean that a server or client cannot track state across requests. One common method for tracking state is the `cookie`. Cookies are generated by a server and passed to the client as an HTTP header.

```http
HTTP/2 200
Set-Cookie: myAppCookie=tasty; SameSite=Strict; Secure; HttpOnly
```

The client then caches the cookie and returns it as an HTTP header back to the server on subsequent requests.

```http
HTTP/2 200
Cookie: myAppCookie=tasty
```

This allows the server to remember things like the language preference of the user, or the user's authentication credentials. A server can also use cookies to track, and share, everything that a user does. However, there is nothing inherently evil about cookies; the problem comes from web applications that use them as a means to violate a user's privacy or inappropriately monetize their data.

## HTTP Versions

HTTP continually evolves in order to increase performance and support new types of applications. You can read about the evolution of HTTP on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Evolution_of_HTTP).

| Year | Version | Features                                        |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1990 | HTTP0.9 | one line, no versions, only get                 |
| 1996 | HTTP1   | get/post, header, status codes, content-type    |
| 1997 | HTTP1.1 | put/patch/delete/options, persistent connection |
| 2015 | HTTP2   | multiplex, server push, binary representation   |
| 2022 | HTTP3   | QUIC for transport protocol, always encrypted   |



# Data services

Web applications commonly need to store application and user data persistently. The data can be many things, but it is usually a representation of complex interrelated objects. This includes things like a user profile, organizational structure, game play information, usage history, billing information, peer relationship, library catalog, and so forth.

![Data service](dataService.jpg)

Historically, SQL databases have served as the general purpose data service solution, but starting around 2010, specialty data services that better support document, graph, JSON, time, sequence, and key-value pair data began to take significant roles in applications from major companies. These data services are often called NoSQL solutions because they do not use the general purpose relational database paradigms popularized by SQL databases. However, they all have very different underlying data structures, strengths, and weaknesses. That means that you should not simply split all of the possible data services into two narrowly defined boxes, SQL and NoSQL, when you are considering the right data service for your application.

Here is a list of some of the popular data services that are available.

| Service       | Specialty             |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| MySQL         | Relational queries    |
| Redis         | Memory cached objects |
| ElasticSearch | Ranked free text      |
| MongoDB       | JSON objects          |
| DynamoDB      | Key value pairs       |
| Neo4J         | Graph based data      |
| InfluxDB      | Time series data      |

## MongoDB

![MongoDB logo](webServicesMongoLogo.png)

For the projects in this course that require data services, we will use `MongoDB`. Mongo increases developer productivity by using JSON objects as its core data model. This makes it easy to have an application that uses JSON from the top to the bottom of the technology stack. A mongo database is made up of one or more collections that each contain JSON documents. You can think of a collection as a large array of JavaScript objects, each with a unique ID. The following is a sample of a collection of houses that are for rent.

```js
[
  {
    _id: '62300f5316f7f58839c811de',
    name: 'Lovely Loft',
    summary: 'A charming loft in Paris',
    beds: 1,
    last_review: {
      $date: '2022-03-15T04:06:17.766Z',
    },
    price: 3000,
  },
  {
    _id: '623010b97f1fed0a2df311f8',
    name: 'Infinite Views',
    summary: 'Modern home with infinite views from the infinity pool',
    property_type: 'House',
    beds: 5,
    price: 250,
  },
];
```

Unlike relational databases that require a rigid table definition where each column must be strictly typed and defined beforehand, Mongo has no strict schema requirements. Each document in the collection usually follows a similar schema, but each document may have specialized fields that are present, and common fields that are missing. This allows the schema of a collection to morph organically as the data model of the application evolves. To add a new field to a Mongo collection you just insert the field into the documents as desired. If the field is not present, or has a different type in some documents, then the document simply doesn't match the query criteria when the field is referenced.

The query syntax for Mongo also follow a JavaScript-inspired flavor. Consider the following queries on the houses for rent collection that was shown above.

```js
// find all houses
db.house.find();

// find houses with two or more bedrooms
db.house.find({ beds: { $gte: 2 } });

// find houses that are available with less than three beds
db.house.find({ status: 'available', beds: { $lt: 3 } });

// find houses with either less than three beds or less than $1000 a night
db.house.find({ $or: [(beds: { $lt: 3 }), (price: { $lt: 1000 })] });

// find houses with the text 'modern' or 'beach' in the summary
db.house.find({ summary: /(modern|beach)/i });
```

### Using MongoDB in your application

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MongoDB tutorial](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/javascript/node-crud-tutorial/)

The first step to using Mongo in your application is to install the `mongodb` package using NPM.

```sh
➜ npm install mongodb
```

With that done, you then use the `MongoClient` object to make a client connection to the database server. This requires a username, password, and the hostname of the database server.

```js
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

const userName = 'holowaychuk';
const password = 'express';
const hostname = 'mongodb.com';

const url = `mongodb+srv://${userName}:${password}@${hostname}`;

const client = new MongoClient(url);
```

With the client connection you can then get a database object and from that a collection object. The collection object allows you to insert, and query for, documents. You do not have to do anything special to insert a JavaScript object as a Mongo document. You just call the `insertOne` function on the collection object and pass it the JavaScript object. When you insert a document, if the database or collection does not exist, Mongo will automatically create them for you. When the document is inserted into the collection it will automatically be assigned a unique ID.

```js
const collection = client.db('rental').collection('house');

const house = {
  name: 'Beachfront views',
  summary: 'From your bedroom to the beach, no shoes required',
  property_type: 'Condo',
  beds: 1,
};
await collection.insertOne(house);
```

To query for documents you use the `find` function on the collection object. Note that the find function is asynchronous and so we use the `await` keyword to wait for the promise to resolve before we write them out to the console.

```js
const cursor = collection.find();
const rentals = await cursor.toArray();
rentals.forEach((i) => console.log(i));
```

If you do not supply any parameters to the `find` function then it will return all documents in the collection. In this case we only get back the single document that we previously inserted. Notice that the automatically generated ID is returned with the document.

**Output**

```js
[
  {
    _id: new ObjectId('639a96398f8de594e198fc13'),
    name: 'Beachfront views',
    summary: 'From your bedroom to the beach, no shoes required',
    property_type: 'Condo',
    beds: 1,
  },
];
```

You can provide a query and options to the `find` function. In the example below we query for a `property_type` of Condo that has less than two bedrooms. We also specify the options to sort by descending price, and limit our results to the first 10 documents.

```js
const query = { property_type: 'Condo', beds: { $lt: 2 } };

const options = {
  sort: { price: -1 },
  limit: 10,
};

const cursor = collection.find(query, options);
const rentals = await cursor.toArray();
rentals.forEach((i) => console.log(i));
```

The query matches the document that we previously inserted and so we get the same result as before.

There is a lot more functionality that MongoDB provides, but this is enough to get you started. If you are interested you can explore the tutorials on their [website](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/).

## Managed services

Historically each application development team would have developers that managed the data service. Those developers would acquire hardware, install the database software, monitor the memory, cpu, and disk space, control the data schema, and handle migrations and upgrades. Much of this work has now moved to services that are hosted and managed by a 3rd party. This relieves the development team from much of the day-to-day maintenance. The team can instead focus more on the application and less on the infrastructure. With a managed data service you simply supply the data and the service grows, or shrinks, to support the desired capacity and performance criteria.

### MongoDB Atlas

All of the major cloud providers offer multiple data services. For this class we will use the data service provided by MongoDB called [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database). No credit card or payment is required to set up and use Atlas, as long as you stick to the shared cluster environment.

[![Mongo sign up](webServicesMongoSignUp.jpg)](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)

⚠ This [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daIH4o75KE8) will step you through the process of creating your account and setting up your database. You really want to watch this video. Note that some of the Atlas website interface may be slightly different, but the basic concepts should all be there in some shape or form. The main steps you need to take are:

1. Create your account.
1. Create a database cluster.
1. Create your root database user credentials. Remember these for later use.
1. ⚠ Set network access to your database to be available from anywhere.

   ![Atlas IP Anywhere](webServicesMongoIpAnywhere.gif)

1. Copy the connection string and use the information in your code.
1. Save the connection and credential information in your production and development environments as instructed above.

You can always find the connection string to your Atlas cluster by pressing the `Connect` button from your Database > DataServices view.

![Atlas connection string](webServicesMongoConnection.gif)

## Keeping your keys out of your code

You need to protect your credentials for connecting to your Mongo database. One common mistake is to check them into your code and then post it to a public GitHub repository. Instead you can load your credentials when the application executes. One common way to do that is to have a JSON configuration file that contains the credentials that you dynamically load into the JavaScript that makes the database connection. You then use the configuration file in your development environment and deploy it to your production environment, but you **never** commit it to GitHub.

In order to accomplish this do the following:

1. Create a file named `dbConfig.json` in the same directory as the database JavaScript (e.g. `database.js`) that you use to make database requests.
1. Insert your Mongo DB credentials into the `dbConfig.json` file in JSON format using the following example:

   ```json
   {
     "hostname": "cs260.abcdefg.mongodb.net",
     "userName": "myMongoUserName",
     "password": "toomanysecrets"
   }
   ```

1. Import the `dbConfig.json` content into your `database.js` file using a Node.js require statement and use the data that it represents to create the connection URL.

   ```js
   const config = require('./dbConfig.json');
   const url = `mongodb+srv://${config.userName}:${config.password}@${config.hostname}`;
   ```

⚠ Make sure you include `dbConfig.json` in your `.gitignore` file so that it does not get pushed up to GitHub.

### Testing the connection on startup

It is nice to know that your connection string is correct before your application attempts to access any data. We can do that when the application starts by making an asynchronous request to ping the database. If that fails then either the connection string is incorrect, the credentials are invalid, or the network is not working. The following is an example of testing the connection.

```js
const config = require('./dbConfig.json');

const url = `mongodb+srv://${config.userName}:${config.password}@${config.hostname}`;
const client = new MongoClient(url);
const db = client.db('rental');

(async function testConnection() {
  await client.connect();
  await db.command({ ping: 1 });
})().catch((ex) => {
  console.log(`Unable to connect to database with ${url} because ${ex.message}`);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

If your server is not starting, then check your logs for this exception being thrown.

## Using Mongo from your code

With that all done, you should be good to use Atlas from both your development and production environments. You can test that things are working correctly with the following example.

```js
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
const config = require('./dbConfig.json');

async function main() {
  // Connect to the database cluster
  const url = `mongodb+srv://${config.userName}:${config.password}@${config.hostname}`;
  const client = new MongoClient(url);
  const db = client.db('rental');
  const collection = db.collection('house');

  // Test that you can connect to the database
  (async function testConnection() {
    await client.connect();
    await db.command({ ping: 1 });
  })().catch((ex) => {
    console.log(`Unable to connect to database with ${url} because ${ex.message}`);
    process.exit(1);
  });

  // Insert a document
  const house = {
    name: 'Beachfront views',
    summary: 'From your bedroom to the beach, no shoes required',
    property_type: 'Condo',
    beds: 1,
  };
  await collection.insertOne(house);

  // Query the documents
  const query = { property_type: 'Condo', beds: { $lt: 2 } };
  const options = {
    sort: { score: -1 },
    limit: 10,
  };

  const cursor = collection.find(query, options);
  const rentals = await cursor.toArray();
  rentals.forEach((i) => console.log(i));
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

To execute the above example, do the following:

1. Create a directory called `mongoTest`
1. Save the above content to a file named `index.js`
1. Create a file named `dbConfig.json` that contains your database credentials
1. Run `npm init -y`
1. Run `npm install mongodb`
1. Run `node index.js`.

This should output something like the following if everything is working correctly.

```js
{
_id: new ObjectId("639b51b74ef1e953b884ca5b"),
name: 'Beachfront views',
summary: 'From your bedroom to the beach, no shoes required',
property_type: 'Condo',
beds: 1
}
```

# ☑ Assignment

First, set up your MongoDB Atlas database service. Then use the instructions above. Run the example program for testing that you have things set up correctly.

When you are done, submit the hostname for your Atlas database cluster to the Canvas assignment.

Here is an example hostname:

```
cs260.xiu1cqz.mongodb.net
```

# Web frameworks

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Introduction to client-side frameworks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Introduction)

Web frameworks seek to make the job of writing web applications easier by providing tools for completing common application tasks. This includes things like modularizing code, creating single page applications, simplifying reactivity, and supporting diverse hardware devices.

Some frameworks take things beyond the standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and create new hybrid file formats that combine things like HTML and JavaScript into a single file. Examples of this include React JSX, Vue SFC, and Svelte files. Abstracting away the core web file formats puts the focus on functional components rather than files.

There are lots of web frameworks to choose from and they evolve all the time. You can view the latest popularity poll at [StateOfJS](https://stateofjs.com).

![web frameworks](stateofjs-webframeworks.jpg)

\- **Source**: _StateOfJS web framework poll_

Each framework has advantages and disadvantages. Some are very prescriptive (opinionated) about how to do things, some have major institutional backing, and others have a strong open source community. Other factors you want to consider include how easy it is to learn, how it impacts productivity, how performant it is, how long it takes to build, and how actively the framework is evolving.

## Hello world examples

For our classwork we will use the web framework React. However, before we dig into React let's look at how the major frameworks would render a simple hello world application.

### Vue

[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a single file. HTML is represented by a `template` element that can be aggregated into other templates.

**SFC**

```html
<script>
  export default {
    data() {
      return {
        name: 'world',
      };
    },
  };
</script>

<style>
  p {
    color: green;
  }
</style>

<template>
  <p>Hello {{ name }}!</p>
</template>
```

### Svelte

Like Vue, [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a single file. The difference here is that Svelte requires a transpiler to generate browser-ready code, instead of a runtime virtual DOM.

**Svelte file**

```html
<script>
  let name = 'world';
</script>

<style>
  p {
    color: green;
  }
</style>

<p>Hello {name}!</p>
```

### React

React combines JavaScript and HTML into its component format. CSS must be declared outside of the JSX file. The component itself highly leverages the functionality of JavaScript and can be represented as a function or class.

**JSX**

```jsx
import 'hello.css';

const Hello = () => {
  let name = 'world';

  return <p>Hello {name}</p>;
};
```

**CSS**

```css
p {
  color: green;
}
```

### Angular component

An Angular component defines what JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are combined together. This keeps a fairly strong separation of files that are usually grouped together in a directory rather than using the single file representation.

**JS**

```js
@Component({
  selector: 'app-hello-world',
  templateUrl: './hello-world.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./hello-world.component.css'],
})
export class HelloWorldComponent {
  name: string;
  constructor() {
    this.name = 'world';
  }
}
```

**HTML**

```html
<p>hello {{name}}</p>
```

**CSS**

```css
p {
  color: green;
}
```


# Security overview

📖 **Deeper dive reading**:

- [Database of publicized software vulnerabilities](https://cve.mitre.org/)
- [SQL Injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection)

The internet allows us to socially connect, conduct financial transactions, and provide access to sensitive individual, corporate, and government data. It is also accessible from every corner of the planet. This positions the internet as a tool that can make the world a much better place, but it also makes a very attractive target for those who would seek to do harm. Preventing that potential for harm needs to be in the forefront of you mind whenever you create or use a web application.

You can see bad actors at work on your very own server by using `ssh` to open a console to your server and reviewing the authorization log. The authorization log captures all of the attempts to create a session on your server.

```sh
sudo less +G /var/log/auth.log
```

The last entry in the log will be from your connection to the server.

```sh
Feb 23 16:26:54 sshd[319071]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user ubuntu(uid=1000) by (uid=0)
Feb 23 16:26:54 systemd-logind[480]: New session 1350 of user ubuntu.
Feb 23 16:26:54 systemd: pam_unix(systemd-user:session): session opened for user ubuntu(uid=1000) by (uid=0)
```

However, you will see lots of other attempts with specific user names associated with common exploits. These all should be failing to connect, but if your server is not configured properly then an unauthorized access is possible. The sample of attempts below show the IP addresses of the attacker, as well as the user name that they used. Using the `whois` utility we can see that these attacks are originating from servers at DLive.kr in Korea, and DigitalOcean.com in the USA.

```sh
Feb 19 02:34:28 sshd[298185]: Invalid user developer from 27.1.253.142
Feb 19 02:37:12 sshd[298193]: Invalid user minecraft1 from 27.1.253.142
Feb 23 14:26:19 sshd[318868]: Invalid user siteadmin 174.138.72.191
Feb 23 14:22:18 sshd[318845]: Invalid user tester 174.138.72.191
```

As an experiment, one of our TAs created a test server with a user named `admin` with password `password`. Within 15 minutes, an attacker had logged in, bypassed all the restrictions that were in place, and started using the server to attack other servers on the internet.

Even if you don't think your application is valuable enough to require security, you need to consider that you might be creating a security problem for your users on other systems. For example, think about a simple game application where a user is required to provides a username and password in order to play the game. If the application's data is then compromised, then an attacker could use the password, used for the game application, to gain access to other websites where the user might have used the same password. For example, their social networking sites, work account, or financial institution.

## Security terminology

Web application security, sometimes called AppSec, is a subset of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on preventing security vulnerabilities within end-user applications. Web application security involves securing the frontend code running on the user's device and also the backend code running on the web server.

Here is a list of common phrases used by the security community that you should be familiar with.

- **Hacking** - The process of making a system do something it's not supposed to do.
- **Exploit** - Code or input that takes advantage of a programming or configuration flaw.
- **Attack Vector** - The method that a hacker employs to penetrate and exploit a system.
- **Attack Surface** - The exposed parts of a system that an attacker can access. For example, open ports (22, 443, 80), service endpoints, or user accounts.
- **Attack Payload** - The actual code, or data, that a hacker delivers to a system in order to exploit it.
- **Input sanitization** - "Cleaning" any input of potentially malicious data.
- **Black box testing** - Testing an application without knowledge of the internals of the application.
- **White box testing** - Testing an application by **with** knowledge of the source code and internal infrastructure.
- **Penetration Testing** - Attempting to gain access to, or exploit, a system in ways that are not anticipated by the developers.
- **Mitigation** - The action taken to remove, or reduce, a threat.

## Motivation for attackers

The following lists some common motivations at drives a system attack.

- **Disruption** - By overloading a system, encrypting essential data, or deleting critical infrastructure, an attacker can destroy normal business operations. This may be an attempt at extortion, or simply be an attempt to punish a business that that attacker does not agree with.
- **Data exfiltration** - By privately extracting, or publicly exposing, a system's data, an attacker can embarrass the company, exploit insider information, sell the information to competitors, or leverage the information for additional attacks.
- **Resource consumption** - By taking control of a company's computing resources an attacker can use it for other purposes such as mining cryptocurrency, gathering customer information, or attacking other systems.

## Examples of security failures

Security should always be a primary objective of any application. Building a web application that looks good and performs well, is a lot less important than building an application that is secure.

Here are a few examples where companies failed to properly prevent attacks to their systems.

- [$100 million dollars stolen through insider trading using SQL injection vulnerability](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/22/17716622/sec-business-wire-hack-stolen-press-release-fraud-ukraine)
- [Log4Shell remote code execution vulnerability, 93% of cloud vulnerable at time of discovery, dubbed "the most severe vulnerability ever"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell)
- [Russian hackers install backdoor on 18,000 government and Fortune 500 computers](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/16/985439655/a-worst-nightmare-cyberattack-the-untold-story-of-the-solarwinds-hack)
- [Hackers Hold Computers of 23 Texas Towns For Ransom](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-08-20/hackers-hold-computers-of-23-texas-towns-for-ransom)

## Common hacking techniques

There are a few common exploitation techniques that you should be aware of. These include the following.

- **Injection**: When an application interacts with a database on the backend, a programmer will often take user input and concatenate it directly into a search query. This allows a hacker can use a specially crafted query to make the database reveal hidden information or even delete the database.

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: A category of attacks where an attacker can make malicious code execute on a different user's browser. If successful, an attacker can turn a website that a user trusts, into one that can steal passwords and hijack a user's account.

- **Denial of Service**: This includes any attack where the main goal is to render any service inaccessible. This can be done by deleting a database using an SQL injection, by sending unexpected data to a service endpoint that causes the program to crash, or by simply making more requests than a server can handle.

- **Credential Stuffing**: People have a tendency to reuse passwords or variations of passwords on different websites. If a hacker has a user's credentials from a previous website attack, then there is a good chance that they can successfully use those credentials on a different website. A hacker can also try to brute force attack a system by trying every possible combination of password.

- **Social engineering** - Appealing to a human's desire to help, in order to gain unauthorized access or information.

## What can I do about it?

Taking the time to learn the techniques a hacker uses to attack a system is the first step in preventing them from exploiting your systems. From there, develop a security mindset, where you always assume any attack surface will be used against you. Make security a consistent part of your application design and feature discussions. Here is a list of common security practices you should include in your applications.

- **Sanitize input data** - Always assume that any data you receive from outside your system will be used to exploit your system. Consider if the input data can be turned into an executable expression, or can overload computing, bandwidth, or storage resources.
- **Logging** - It is not possible to think of every way that your system can be exploited, but you can create an immutable log of requests that will expose when a system is being exploited. You can then trigger alerts, and periodically review the logs for unexpected activity.
- **Traps** - Create what appears to be valuable information and then trigger alarms when the data is accessed.
- **Educate** - Teach yourself, your users, and everyone you work with, to be security minded. Anyone who has access to your system should understand how to prevent physical, social, and software attacks.
- **Reduce attack surfaces** - Do not open access anymore than is necessary to properly provide your application. This includes what network ports are open, what account privileges are allowed, where you can access the system from, and what endpoints are available.
- **Layered security** - Do not assume that one safeguard is enough. Create multiple layers of security that each take different approaches. For example, secure your physical environment, secure your network, secure your server, secure your public network traffic, secure your private network traffic, encrypt your storage, separate your production systems from your development systems, put your payment information in a separate environment from your application environment. Do not allow data from one layer to move to other layers. For example, do not allow an employee to take data out of the production system.
- **Least required access policy** - Do not give any one user all the credentials necessary to control the entire system. Only give a user what access they need to do the work they are required to do.
- **Safeguard credentials** - Do not store credentials in accessible locations such as a public GitHub repository or a sticky note taped to a monitor. Automatically rotate credentials in order to limit the impact of an exposure. Only award credentials that are necessary to do a specific task.
- **Public review** - Do not rely on obscurity to keep your system safe. Assume instead that an attacker knows everything about your system and then make it difficult for anyone to exploit the system. If you can attack your system, then a hacker will be able to also. By soliciting public review and the work of external penetration testers, you will be able to discover and remove potential exploits.


# WebSocket

![webSocket](webServicesWebSocketsLogo.png)

HTTP is based on a client-server architecture. A client always initiates the request and the server responds. This is great if you are building a global document library connected by hyperlinks, but for many other use cases it just doesn't work. Applications for notifications, distributed task processing, peer-to-peer communication, or asynchronous events need communication that is initiated by two or more connected devices.

For years, web developers created hacks to work around the limitation of the client/server model. This included solutions like having the client frequently pinging the server to see if the server had anything to say, or keeping client-initiated connections open for a very long time as the client waited for some event to happen on the server. Needless to say, none of these solutions were elegant or efficient.

Finally, in 2011 the communication protocol WebSocket was created to solve this problem. The core feature of WebSocket is that it is fully duplexed. This means that after the initial connection is made from a client, using vanilla HTTP, and then upgraded by the server to a WebSocket connection, the relationship changes to a peer-to-peer connection where either party can efficiently send data at any time.

![WebSocket Upgrade](webServicesWebSocketUpgrade.jpg)

WebSocket connections are still only between two parties. So if you want to facilitate a conversation between a group of users, the server must act as the intermediary. Each peer first connects to the server, and then the server forwards messages amongst the peers.

## Creating a WebSocket conversation

JavaScript running on a browser can initiate a WebSocket connection with the browser's WebSocket API. First you create a WebSocket object by specifying the port you want to communicate on.

You can then send messages with the `send` function, and register a callback using the `onmessage` function to receive messages.

```js
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:9900');

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('received: ', event.data);
};

socket.send('I am listening');
```

The server uses the `ws` package to create a WebSocketServer that is listening on the same port the browser is using. By specifying a port when you create the WebSocketServer, you are telling the server to listen for HTTP connections on that port and to automatically upgrade them to a WebSocket connection if the request has a `connection: Upgrade` header.

When a connection is detected it calls the server's `on connection` callback. The server can then send messages with the `send` function, and register a callback using the `on message` function to receive messages.

```js
const { WebSocketServer } = require('ws');

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 9900 });

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  ws.on('message', (data) => {
    const msg = String.fromCharCode(...data);
    console.log('received: %s', msg);

    ws.send(`I heard you say "${msg}"`);
  });

  ws.send('Hello webSocket');
});
```

In a later instruction we will show you how to run and debug this example.


# Authorization services

If your application is going to remember a user's data then it will need a way to uniquely associate the data with a particular credential. That usually means that you `authenticate` a user by asking for information, such as an email address and password. You then remember, for some period of time, that the user has authenticated by storing an `authentication token` on the user's device. Often that token is stored in a [cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cookie) that is passed back to your web service on each request. The service can now associate data that the user supplies with a unique identifier that corresponds to their authorization token.

![authentication](authServiceAuthenticate.jpg)

Determining what a user is `authorized` to do in your application is also important. For example, you might have different roles in your application such as Administrators, Editors, and Customers. Once you have the ability to authenticate a user and store information about that user, you can also store the authorization for the user. A simple application might have a single field that represents the role of the user. The service code would then use that role to allow, limit, or prevent what a service endpoint does. A complex web application will usually have very powerful authorization representation that controls the user's access to every part of the application. For example, an Editor role might have authorization only to work on content that they created or were invited to.

As you might imagine, authentication and authorization can become very complex, very quickly. It is also a primary target for a hacker. If they can bypass the authentication or escalate what they are authorized to do, then they can gain control of your application. Additionally, constantly forcing users to authenticate in a secure way causes users to not want to use an application. This creates opposing priorities: keep the system secure or make it easy to use.

In an attempt to remove the complexity of authentication and authorization from your application, many service providers and package developers have created solutions that you can use. Assuming that you are using a trusted, well-tested service this is an attractive option because it removes the cost of building, testing, and managing that critical infrastructure yourself.

Authorization services often use standard protocols for authenticating and authorizing. These include standards such as [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth), [SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language), and [OIDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID). Additionally, they usually support concepts like `Single Sign On` (SSO) and Federated Login. Single sign on allows a user to use the same credentials for multiple web applications. For example, you can log in to GitHub using your Google credentials. Federated login allows a user to log in once, and then the authentication token is reused to automatically log the user in to multiple websites. For example, logging in to Gmail allows you to also use Google Docs and YouTube without logging in again.

For this course we will implement our own authentication using a simple email/password design. Knowing how to implement a simple authentication design will help you appreciate what authentication services provide. If you want to experiment with different authorization services you might consider [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), or [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth).
